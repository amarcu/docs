# FIAT

## Glossary

**Collateral** - Asset or security that can be used to repay a loan in the event of a default or a liquidation event.

**Illiquid** vs **Liquid** - Illiquid assets cannot be easily sold or exchanged for a different asset. Liquid assets usually have a market for trading and can easily be exchanged for another asset.

**Fixed Income** - A type of investment security that pays an investor a fixed dividend based on an interest rate until the maturity date is reached.

**Stable Coin** - A token that is designed to have price stability and is backed by a reserve asset or through other algorithmic means.

**LTV** - **Loan-To-Value** is the ratio of a debt position to the total amount of deposited collateral. If a user borrows $1000 with $5000 as collateral, their LTV is 20%.

**Liquidation** - A user's collateral can be liquidated if their debt position reaches a certain LTV %.

**FIAT Token** - A stable ERC20 token that can be minted against a user's deposited collateral.

**Vault Adapters** - Allows users to enter a vault with a fixed income token represented by ERC1155, ERC721, or ERC20 standards. These vault adapters may implement specific vaults for different fixed-income protocols.

**Codex** - The centralized accounting contract for the FIAT ecosystem.

**Collybus** - Smart contract used for determining the price of an illiquid asset with no secondary market.

**Moneta** - Smart contract a user interacts with to mint FIAT token which is counted as debt against their collateral in the vault.

**Proxy Actions** - Allows a user to interact with the ecosystem of contracts in a single transaction (i.e. enter a vault and borrow FIAT).
