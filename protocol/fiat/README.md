# ðŸŒ… FIAT

FIAT allows users to mint a stable-value token called $FIAT against fixed income assets originated on various DeFi platforms in order to facilitate use cases like yield releveraging and arbitrage. By providing users with a collateralized credit facility, FIAT reduces the opportunity cost of underwriting DeFi debt positions and aggregates secondary liquidity for such assets.&#x20;

The FIAT system is designed such that the total $FIAT debt outstanding is fully backed by deposited collateral value akin to a full-reserve currency system. Furthermore, the system maintains an internal 1 USD $FIAT price target. It implements a number of mechanisms which calibrate the supply and demand for $FIAT in order for these targets to be maintained.
