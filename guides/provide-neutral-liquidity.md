  liquidity

# ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ Provide Neutral Liquidity

## Guide Intro

$FIAT requires deep secondary liquidity in order to facilitate its core use cases. This guide provides a walkthrough on how to contribute to both $FIAT circulating supply and secondary liquidity.

**What You'll Need:**

* $USDC or $DAI for deposits
* $ETH for gas fees

**What Protocols You'll Potentially Use:**

* Collateral Partner ([Element](https://element.fi), [Notional](https://notional.finance), or [Yield](https://yieldprotocol.com))
* [Balancer Finance](https://balancer.fi)
* [Aura Finance](https://aura.finance)
* [Yearn Finance](https://yearn.finance)

**End Goal**

By the end of this guide, you'll have created a collateral position, minted $FIAT, paired it against either $USDC or $DAI on Balancer Finance, and begun to earn subsidies.&#x20;

## How-To Guide

### Step 1. Mint $FIAT

* Navigate to [https://app.fiatdao.com](https://app.fiatdao.com)
* Select a collateral option from your preferred issuer
* Deposit your collateral and mint $FIAT with enough of a buffer to avoid liquidation

{% hint style="warning" %}
Stablecoin-denominated positions can be liquidated due to depegs or interest accumulation. **Health scores greater than 1.025 are recommended.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Step 2. Pair $FIAT

* Navigate to the "FUD" (FIAT-USDC-DAI) pool on [Balancer Finance](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x178e029173417b1f9c8bc16dcec6f697bc32374600000000000000000000025d)
* Deposit your $FIAT alongside equal amounts of $DAI and $USDC

{% hint style="info" %}
It is possible to deposit any combination of the three assets.
{% endhint %}

### Step 3. Choose Your Reward

Once you have received the [proof-of-liquidity token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x178e029173417b1f9c8bc16dcec6f697bc323746) from Balancer Finance, you can choose to deposit it in one of following three options:

#### Option 1: Voting-Escrow Balancer

Balancer Finance emits reward tokens across its pools on weekly cycles. To receive those directed at the FUD pool, you can stake your proof-of-liquidity on the same page as where you initially deposited your assets.&#x20;

![You are eligible for veBAL staking incentives once your proof-of-liquidity is staked.](../.gitbook/assets/571F698C-C7F2-4235-A919-6F3401F49107.jpeg)

The value of the subsidy you receive is a function of the following considerations:

* The amount of [$BAL](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/balancer) token emissions targeted at the pool in a given week
* Your share of the total pool size
* The boosted share you receive as a function of any [veBAL](https://app.balancer.fi/#/vebal) balance you may have
* The value of the $BAL token upon your claim

**Option 2: Vote-Locked Aura**

Aura Finance is an aggregator protocol built on top of Balancer Finance. It allows you to benefit from boosted $BAL emissions it receives due to its accumulated veBAL treasury. It further subsidizes your participation via the emissions of its own governance token, [$AURA](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aura-finance).&#x20;

To utilize the platform, you must  deposit your Balancer proof-of-liquidity in their smart contract.

![Depositing your Balancer Pool Token with Aura allows you to benefit from a boosted share of $BAL emissions.](../.gitbook/assets/C205BBD5-82AB-4D44-8934-AADF81231368.jpeg)

The value of the subsidy you receive is the same as with depositing directly with Balancer Finance, except with Aura Finance, you are likely to receive a higher governance boost, plus the value of their $AURA emissions.

**Option 3: Auto-Compounding Aura Strategy**

Lastly, you can choose to deposit your Balancer pool token with Yearn Finance via their vault smart contract found on [Ape Tax](https://ape.tax/0xA9412Ffd7E0866755ae0dda3318470A61F62abe8). While this introduces yet another risk vector in the form of smart contract vulnerability risk, it does present the opportunity for higher yields than the other options.&#x20;

![Depositing into Yearn Finance's vault for FUD allows you to benefit from auto-compounding with a single deposit transaction.](../.gitbook/assets/003CF478-0299-4B1E-9C37-8D60BDD95661.jpeg)

This vault strategy deposits into Aura Finance a la Option 2, but it auto-compounds subsidies received, selling the $BAL and $AURA earned for more of the underlying FUD pool tokens.&#x20;

## End Result

### Overview

Successful execution of this guide will result in the following outcomes:

*   **Income:**

    * Collateral's Fixed Yield
    * Balancer Pool Trading Fees
    * Balancer Pool Subsidies
    * Aura Finance Subsidies
    * Yearn Finance Auto-Compounding


*   **Costs:**

    * Gas Fees
    * FIAT Interest Charged
    * Yearn Finance Yield Fee


* **Risks:**
  * Collateral Issuer Counterparty Risk
  * Balancer, Aura, or Yearn Finance Smart Contract Risk
  * $USDC, $DAI, or $FIAT Depeg Risk

### Example Position

An example end position could look as follows:

1. User starts with 10,000 $USDC
   * User deposits 5,000 $USDC into Notional fUSDC and secures a 4.8% fixed yield
2. User deposits 5,240 12-month dated $fUSC into FIAT DAO
   * FIAT assesses its value at $0.96 on the dollar and enforces a 105% marginal collateralization ratio
   * User mints 4,700 $FIAT in order to preserve a 1.02 health score on the position
   * User is being charged an annualized 1% interest rate on their $FIAT debt
3. User pairs 4,700 $FIAT against the remaining 5,000 $USDC in the Balancer FUD pool
   * User can further decide whether to deposit into either Aura or Yearn Finance
4. Upon collateral maturity, user withdraws from Balancer pool and repays debt
   * User will owe 4747 $FIAT to unlock their collateral

In the interim period, the user could have minted further $FIAT as the discount rate decreased closer to collateral maturity.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Should $FIAT undergo a prolonged depeg event, the user may be unable to recover their entire $USDC deposited into the Balancer pool. At the same time, the cost to repay the user's $FIAT debt will have declined.\
\
**This is effectively a bank run scenario on the Balancer pool in which, while the user has a short position on $FIAT, they would still want to be the first to withdraw.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Closing Comments

By executing this strategy, the user contributes to the overall secondary liquidity for $FIAT in return for lending yields, trading fees, and protocol subsidies. In pairing minted $FIAT against their own $USDC or $DAI liquidity, they are able to profit from volatility that may result from excess amounts of $FIAT in the Balancer pool, as such events allow for cheap repayment of their minted debt.&#x20;

Importantly, the presence of such neutral liquidity allows for less risk-averse users to execute releveraging strategies with a smaller impact on the secondary price of $FIAT.
