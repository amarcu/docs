# FDT FAQ

**What is $FDT?**

* $FDT is the ERC-20 token that governs over the FIAT DAO protocol. Holders can steward the direction of protocol development by earning voting power for use in direct, token-weighted democratic decisions.&#x20;

**Was there an ICO?**

* $FDT was never sold to the public via an initial coin offering. It has only ever been publicly distributed through freely earned emissions.&#x20;

**Was there a "pre-mine" for $FDT?**

* The $FDT token supply was instantiated with [1,000,000,000 units](https://etherscan.io/token/0xed1480d12be41d92f36f5f7bdd88212e381a3677#balances). 14.5% of this supply was set aside for FIAT DAO founding contributors with weekly vesting over the course of 150 weeks. 10% of this supply was set aside for initial seed contributors with weekly vesting over the course of 100 weeks. Lastly, 5.5% was set aside for advisors who contributed either technical or strategic know-how with weekly vesting over the course of 150 weeks.

**What can I do with my $FDT?**

* You can deposit your $FDT against ETH in the [80-20 Balancer Finance pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x2d344a84bac123660b021eebe4eb6f12ba25fe8600020000000000000000018a). The deposit receipt token you receive will serve as the basis for FIAT DAO governance pending an overhaul in July 2022. The power conferred for doing so will unlock commanding rights over revenues earned by the FIAT protocol.
