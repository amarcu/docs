# Fixed Income FAQ

**What is fixed income?**

* Fixed income assets are those which represent deposits in yield-bearing opportunities with **i)** a known maturity date, and **ii)** a known return for doing so.

**How does DeFi offer fixed income?**

* There are a handful of protocols in DeFi today that offer fixed income. They do so primarily in one of two ways. **Yield-splitting protocols** allow users to isolate the yield generated by a variable rate opportunity into a separate token from their initial deposit. This allows users to earn fixed income either by immediately selling the "yield token" or by purchasing "principal tokens" in the secondary market at a discount to their face value and then redeeming them upon maturity. **Fixed-rate lending protocols** offer users the ability to lend their assets to a fixed rate loan issuing pool. In either case, FIAT DAO is able to accept such assets with relative certainty around their future value.&#x20;

**Can FIAT DAO interface with real world fixed income?**

* FIAT DAO does not currently support tokenized representations of real world fixed income assets as collateral.&#x20;
