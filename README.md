# 🚀 Getting Started

FIAT DAO is the on-chain cooperative stewarding the development of the FIAT protocol. FIAT stands for **F**ixed **I**ncome **A**sset **T**oken. FIAT allows user to mint a singular ERC-20 stable value asset against a universe of fixed income assets, facilitating both leverage and secondary market use cases.&#x20;

**FIAT is simultaneously a software protocol, a community of builders, and an ecosystem of applications - we want to make it as easy as possible for you to learn what it’s all about and to start contributing.**

## FIAT - The Protocol

Our protocol allows users to collateralize fixed-income assets issued by other DeFi applications and borrow an asset, FIAT, against it. The following checklist is meant to provide you with a foundational understanding of how it works.
