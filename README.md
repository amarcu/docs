# ðŸš€ Getting Started

FIAT DAO is the on-chain cooperative stewarding the development of the FIAT protocol. FIAT stands for **F**ixed **I**ncome **A**sset **T**oken. FIAT allows user to mint a singular ERC-20 stable value asset ([$FIAT](https://etherscan.io/token/0x586Aa273F262909EEF8fA02d90Ab65F5015e0516)) against a universe of fixed income assets, unlocking liquidity for the duration of the deposit.&#x20;

**FIAT is simultaneously a software protocol, a community of builders, and an ecosystem of applications - we want to make it as easy as possible for you to learn what itâ€™s all about and to start contributing.**

**Our GitBook serves as developer documentation;  we are building out a Community Portal for a more holistic overview of FIAT.**
