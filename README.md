# ðŸš€ Getting Started

FIAT DAO is the on-chain cooperative stewarding the development of the FIAT protocol. FIAT stands for **F**ixed **I**ncome **A**sset **T**oken. FIAT allows user to mint a singular ERC-20 asset ([$FIAT](https://etherscan.io/token/0x586Aa273F262909EEF8fA02d90Ab65F5015e0516)) against a universe of fixed income assets, unlocking liquidity for the duration of the deposit.

**FIAT is simultaneously a software protocol, a community of builders, and an ecosystem of applications - we want to make it as easy as possible for you to learn what itâ€™s all about and to start contributing.**

Our documentation is split up into the following sections:

* **Protocol:** How the FIAT system architecture is designed
* **Guides:** How to interact with FIAT, both as a builder and as a user
* **Governance:** How on-chain governance over the protocol is implemented
* **Programs:** Explainers of previous or ongoing on-chain programs hosted by the DAO
* **Resources:** Quick references for builders and users alike
