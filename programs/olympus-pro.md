# â™Ž Olympus Pro

Olympus Pro is a service offering of the OlympusDAO community that standardizes the accumulation of protocol-owned value. Participating projects are able to issue short-term bonds of their respective asset in exchange for a targeted asset - examples include proofs of liquidity, certain governance tokens, or simply ether - at a dynamic discount or premium to spot prices informed by demand. The OlympusDAO community hosts the interface for buying bonds on their own interface, while assets accumulate in a receiving vault for which only the partner project has withdrawal rights.
